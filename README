This is a script to demonstrate how compute instances with NFS mount can be created for on-demand needs.

In this script, the Dell Technologies PowerScale scale-out NFS storage has been already configured for Google Cloud Platform. In it's place any other NFS server with an export already configured would work.

A Storage bucket with the startup script in it is assumed

This script can be useful for anyone learning some GCP concepts.

This script is NOT meant to be run in PRODUCTION environments.

Usage
========
./create-compute.sh

It will ask two choices - a) setupenv - use this to setup the Instance Template and the Instance Group and b) setupcompute - use this option to create compute instances by picking your template.

The script offers options to delete templates and instance groups.
